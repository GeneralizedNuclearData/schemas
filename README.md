# schemas
Schemas defining the GNDS format. Hosting the schemas in a public place allows anyone to refer to them and a common place to store them.

There doesn't have to be a single schema or a single format for the schema. The schemas are located in the various directories based on the format of the schema. The GNDS version number should be indicated in the filename of the schema such as:

```
json/
  gnds-2.0.json
```
